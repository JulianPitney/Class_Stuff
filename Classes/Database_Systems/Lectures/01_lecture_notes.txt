Chapter 2 Notes:


Data Model= Notation for describing data or info. 
Consists of 3 parts;

1. Structure of data. (Data structures used to implement data)
Note: In context of databases "data structures" may be called
"physical data model"

2. Operations on Data: Limited set of operations allowed on data.

3. Constraints on Data: Limited set of ways data can be stored or values
it can take.

The 2 important data models we'll study are;

1. Relational Model.
2. Semistructured-Data Model.


Relational Model:

Relation == 2D Table (These tables are what programmers are meant to think about
when accessing/modifying data. They serve as a high level abstraction for a much
more efficient data-structure implementation under the hood).
Operations performed on these relations are made up of relational algebra.

Semitructured-Data Model:

Resembles trees or graphs rather than tables.
XML is a good example of this (consisting of hierarchical nested tagged elements).
Operations are performed on this model by following the trees or graphs to get to
the desired element.
